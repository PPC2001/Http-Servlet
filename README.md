# Http-Servlet

In this example, a Servlet is created by extending the HttpServlet abstract class. The purpose of this Servlet is to demonstrate a simple functionality. To achieve this, two pages are created: "register.html" and "success.jsp".The "register.html" page contains a form where the user can input data. When the user clicks the submit button, the data is sent to the Servlet for processing.The Servlet, which extends the HttpServlet abstract class, handles the request and performs the necessary actions. It retrieves the data from the submitted form and processes it accordingly.Once the processing is complete, the Servlet redirects the user to the "success.jsp" page. This page is displayed to the user as a confirmation that the form submission was successful.

Overall, this demonstration showcases the use of a Servlet to handle form data and display a success page in response to a user's action.
